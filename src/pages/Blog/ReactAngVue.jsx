      <Text>
        <strong>React</strong> <br />
        React.js or simply React are the different names of this framework. It
        is basically a JavaScript-based framework launched in 2013 by Jordan
        Walke. It is an open-source framework that allows you to create
        interactive UI and the front-end of the app. To begin with this
        framework, all you need is to hire a web developer. Despite being a
        young library of JavaScript, React has maintained its position by
        offering outstanding features and functions. Apart, the industry's
        leading brands including Uber, Netflix, PayPal, Walmart have shown trust
        in React.

        <strong>Angular</strong>
        <br />
        Undoubtedly, Angular is the biggest framework among these three options.
        In fact, it is being called at times a Platform rather than a framework.
        However, the unmatched features of React have surpassed Angular. Angular
        was developed by Google in 2009 as an open-source dynamic web app
        framework by Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons. After that, Angular offers
        out-of-the-box support for many things, therefore allowing developers to
        have full control on UI, reaction to User input, validating the input in
        forms, routing and state management sending AJAX HTTP requests and more.
        With a wide choice of in-build features, Angular allows you to build,
        manage and test your app much more efficiently. In addition, it is a
        widely popular framework for front-end development, therefore giant
        organizations such as Google, Forbes, Whatsapp and other 500 companies
        have shown interest in this framework. Apart, here are the pros and cons
        of using Angular for the app development project.

        <strong>Vue</strong>
        <br />
        Vue.js is a most-discussed and rapidly growing JavaScript-based
        framework that is initiated by Google's Ex-employee Evan You. It is a
        framework that sits somewhere between React and Angular. A web app
        development company can explain you its features . But before you you
        make any decision, keep in mind that Vue is not as big as Angular it
        includes such features that make it competitive to React and Angular.
        Vue.js is a progressive framework that allows you to create progressive
        single-page apps. Like Angular and React, Vue is also all about
        developing User Interfaces by combining reusable components. But beyond
        that, Vue gives you more of React and less of Angular which is why it is
        surpassing Angular.
